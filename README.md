Yo, It's Vukosi.  
<br>
Or incase any employers looking at this "Salutations tis Vukosi Blessing Mohlabini III" <br>
I started my journy in programming in 2022 and have been punishing my keyboard ever since. Honestly tech is just my passion, I love everything tech related,
whether it's networking, artificial intelligence or software. <br>
Have fun looking through my projects from my early days (when I still had to google search how to center a div everyday) to know, when i still have to sometimes
search how to center a div but a bit more capable. <br>
If you tryna fork anything or just give constructive critisism on my code hit me up.<br>
