Hello, I'm Vukosi Blessing Mohlabini.

I began my programming journey in 2022 and have been immersed in tech ever since. I'm deeply passionate about all things technologyâ€”whether it's software development, networking, or artificial intelligence. This portfolio showcases some of the projects I've built, starting from my early days (when centering a <div> felt like rocket science) to more recent work as I've grown more confident and capable.

Feel free to explore, fork any projects, or reach out with feedback or collaboration ideas.
